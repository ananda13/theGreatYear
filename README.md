<h3>What is the world like?</h3>

Its 2034. Politically, the world has been slowly devolving into chaos, with the rise of extreme elements. Different factions are rallying for power; hardcore capitalist-leftist movement has kept up its momentum, extreme religious movements has flared up all over the world. The Islamists in the Middle East won large swaths of territory, but came to ceasefire agreement at the threat of nuclear warfare. On the other hand, people are more aware, technology has helped more and more people to free themselves from ignorance and struggle. It feels like crossroads, and the human race seems trapped. There is an 'eye of the storm' feeling, like everything is swirling around, just out of reach, maybe doom, maybe release. But there is a calm right now.
